### Left panel

In the left panel you see all the Block types and, below, all the Page types. Clicking on a Block or Page, you'll see the details on the right.

### Central panel

The central panel shows the default content for a block or a page. Here you can test that the block works as expected with the Wysiwyg editing and the side-edit props.

### Right panel

The right panel has 2 tabs for a Block Type:

- **Props edit**: where you see the available side-edit props.
- **Allowed in**: where you see the pages where this block is available

And 2 tabs for a Page Type:

- **Block**: the usual props editing.
- **Page settings**: where you see the default status (locked/unlocked, publoshed/draft) and the blocks allowed in this page
