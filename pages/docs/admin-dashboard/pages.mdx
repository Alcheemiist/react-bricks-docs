# Working with pages

## What is a Page?

A Page in React Bricks represent a **unit of content**.  
Using the default starter projects, it corresponds to a page of the website, or a blog post.

But when you think that you may connect a React Bricks Page to any entity of a Headless CMS or an e-commerce product, a new world of possibilities opens up (stay tuned ðŸ›°)

## Page editing

You can edit the content of the page (blocks) and its meta information (name, slug, title, description, language, tags, author, featured image, published/draft, locked/unlocked) through the Admin dashboard.

> **A page with slug `"home"` is required**.when you use the Starter projects, as it becomes the website's **Home page**.

Each page has a `pageType` (see [Page Types](/docs/configuration/page-types)).

When you create a page, based on the schema of its page type, it has a **default content**, status, lock status, language and it may have only some of the bricks available to be used as content blocks.

> If the content from the database contains some **blocks unknown or not allowed** (for example because they are no more allowed), you will see a **warning** with the number and type of invalid blocks. By saving the page, you will remove these invalid blocks.

## Locked Pages

The content of a Locked page can be edited but it isn't possible to add / remove / sort blocks, so the page structure is fixed.

For `<Repeater>` Blocks, new items can be added or removed even if the page is locked.
