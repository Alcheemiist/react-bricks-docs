# Click to edit

When you are logged in the Admin dashboard and you navigate the live website (which uses React Bricks' Viewer), you will see a small pencil icon that you can click to directly go to the Admin interface editing that page.

<Video src="/videos/click_to_edit.mp4" />

If you have more than one language, you will go to the editing interface for that page in the currently displayed language.

Via [React Bricks configuration's](../configuration/configuration) `clickToEditSide` you can choose in which corner the "click to edit" button should appear.
