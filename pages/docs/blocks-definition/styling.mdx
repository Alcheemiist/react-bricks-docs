# Styling

**React Bricks doesn't impose you any CSS or CSS-in-JS framework.**  
The Admin interface CSS is decoupled from the page styles and the content blocks styles.

We suggest you to try Tailwind CSS, because [we love it](https://dev.to/matfrana/why-i-love-tailwind-css-3gek) and we think that it is a great tool to create a coherent design system.

> We are creating many useful example blocks using Tailwind CSS.  
> We'll made them available soon, so... stay tuned! ğŸš€
