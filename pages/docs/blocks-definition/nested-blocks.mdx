# Nested blocks

React Bricks allows you to have **blocks which have an array of items inside**.  
For example a Gallery of images or a Features section of a website.

## Repeater block (the container)

The repeater block must be of type `REPEATER`.

It is like a normal block, but it receives a `renderItems` prop, which is a render function that must be called to render the children items in the right position within the returned JSX.

## API

A block of type `REPEATER` has the following specific properties:

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `itemsType` | It corresponds to the unique `name` of the repeated items Block Type (for example _"feature-item"_) |
| `addItemText` | The text for the button to add a new item (for example _"Add feature"_) |
| `removeItemText` | The text for the button to remove an item (for example _"Remove feature"_) |
| `getDefaultProps` | For a repeater block, you may specify also the special `items` prop to populate the children items whenever a new block of this type is added to the page. |

## Usage example

```ts
...

itemsType: BlockNames.LogoGridItem,
addItemText: 'Add logo',
removeItemText: 'Remove logo',
getDefaultProps: () => ({
  items: [
    {
      id: uuid(),
      type: BlockNames.LogoGridItem,
      props: {
        imageSource: { ... },
        name: Plain.deserialize('React'),
      },
    },
  ],
}),
```

## Repeated Item Block

A repeated block is a normal block, but it must spread `...rest` props on its root element in order to correctly focus the element and display it as focused, as you can see below:

```jsx
const LogoGridItem: React.FC<IProps> = ({ imageSource, name, onChange, ...rest }) => {
  return (
    <div className="w-64 px-6 pb-16 flex flex-col" {...rest}>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
