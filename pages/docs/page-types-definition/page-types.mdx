# Page Types

Page types are a way to group similar pages together.

Page of the same type share:

- **Allowed / excluded block types**
- **Default status for new pages**: locked or unlocked, draft or published
- **Default content and language**

The `pageTypeSchema` is an array of pageType objects which is part of the configuration object passed to the `ReactBricks` component.

If you are using a starter project, you may just edit the `pageSchema.js` file in the `/react-bricks` directory.

## API

Each pageType object has the following shape:

```ts
interface IPageType {
  name: string
  pluralName: string
  allowedBlockTypes?: string[]
  excludedBlockTypes?: string[]
  defaultLocked?: boolean
  defaultStatus?: PageStatus
  defaultLanguage?: string
  getDefaultContent?: () => IContentBlock[]
}
```

## Properties definition

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The unique name for this page type (for example _"product"_). |
| `pluralName` | The plural name is used in the editing interface (for example _"Products"_). |
| `allowedBlockTypes` | Array with the names of the block types allowed for this page type. All the other blocks will not be allowed.<br /><br />By default all block types are allowed. |
| `excludedBlockTypes` | Array with the names of the block types not allowed for this page type. It is convenient if almost all block types are allowed.<br /><br />React Bricks will exclude all blocks:<br />- Found in the `excludedBlockTypes` list<br />- Not found in the `allowedBlockTypes` list, if this is provided. |
| `defaultLocked` | The default lock status for new pages. For example, if you want the products to have a fixed structure, you may provide the default content and set the `defaultLocked` flag to true. |
| `defaultStatus` | The default visibility status (draft / published) for new pages of this type. |
| `defaultLanguage` | The default [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language for this pageType. It is used in the `<html>` tag to identify the document language. Defaults to "en". |
| `getDefaultContent` | Function that returns the default content for a new page. The content is an array of contentBlocks, where each contentBlock is an object with this shape `{ id, type, props }`<br /><br />- The `id` must be unique (we suggest that you use the `uuid()` function exported by react-bricks.<br />- The `type` is the type of block.<br />- `props` is an object with the props for the block component.<br /><br />For your convenience, the Admin user can copy the content of a page to clipboard (Document tab in right pane), to use it as a starting point for default content. |

## Usage example

```jsx
const pageSchema = [
  {
    name: 'page',
    pluralName: 'pages',
    defaultLocked: false,
    defaultStatus: types.PageStatus.Published,
    getDefaultContent: () => [],
  },
]
```
