# Working with pages

## What is a Page?

A Page in React Bricks represent a **unit of content**.  
Using the default starter projects, it corresponds to a page of the website.

But when you think that you may connect a React Bricks Page to any entity of a Headless CMS or an e-commerce product, a new world of possibilities opens up (stay tuned ðŸ›°)

## Page editing

You can edit the content of the page and its meta information (name, slug, meta title, meta description, language, published/draft, locked/unlocked) through the Admin dashboard.

> A thing to remember, when using the starter projects, is that **the page with slug `"home"` is the website homepage**.

Each page has a `pageType` (see [Page Types](/docs/page-types-definition/page-types)).

Based on the schema of its page type, when you create a page, it has a **default content**, status, lock status, language and it may have only some of the block types available.

> If the content from the database contains some **blocks unknown or not allowed** (for example because they are no more allowed), you will see a **warning** with the number and type of invalid blocks. By saving the page, you will remove these invalid blocks.
