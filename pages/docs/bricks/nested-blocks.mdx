# Nested blocks

You can have any number of repeating blocks inside a content block.  
For example a Gallery of images or a "Features" section of a website.

## How does it work

You need two things to make it work:

1. Use a React Bricks [`<Repeater>`](/api-reference/visual-components/repeater) component where you need a repeating block
2. Set up the [`repeaterItems`](repeater-items) property in the component's `schema`
3. Set default props for the repeating items to have an initial set of nested blocks when a new block is created
