# Intro to Visual editing

In your Brick components you may use React Bricks exported components.  
Three of them are needed for Visual (WYSIWYG) editing.

They are:

- [`Text`](/api-reference/visual-components/text) **for one-line plain texts.**
- [`RichText`](/api-reference/visual-components/rich-text) **for multiline rich text editing.**  
  You may choose the available rich text features (bold, italic, link, code, highlight) and provide custom components for these markers.
- [`Image`](/api-reference/visual-components/image) **to allow inline uploading of images.**  
  On the Admin this component allow the upload, then our APIs will create a small size placeholder for lazy loading and responsive versions to optimize data transfer.  
  On the frontend, this component lazyload the images and uses the sourceSet created on the server to load the optimal image size.

See [Text](/api-reference/visual-components/text), [RichText](/api-reference/visual-components/rich-text) and [Image](/api-reference/visual-components/image) components.
