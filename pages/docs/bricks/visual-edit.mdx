# Intro to Visual editing

In your Brick components you can use React Bricks exported Visual editing components.

## Text

Used for on-line plain text.

See the [Text docs](/api-reference/visual-components/text)

## RichText

Used for multiline rich text editing.  
You may choose the available rich text features (bold, italic, link, code, highlight, headings, quote) and provide custom render functions for each feature.

See the [RichText docs](/api-reference/visual-components/rich-text)

## RichTextExt

This is the new extensible version of the `RichText` component. It is based on a plugins system, which allows you to customize also the buttons, the shortcut hot keys and create custom plugins from scratch.

See the [RichTextExt docs](/api-reference/visual-components/rich-text-ext).

To extend the RichText behavior, you may see also plugin helpers like [markPluginConstructor](/api-reference/utilities/mark-plugin-constructor) and [blockPluginConstructor](/api-reference/utilities/block-plugin-constructor).

## Image

The image component allows the user to upload images. React Bricks APIs will create a small size placeholder for lazy loading and responsive versions to optimize data transfer.  
On the frontend, this component lazyloads the images and uses the sourceSet created on the server to load the optimal image size.

See the [Image docs](/api-reference/visual-components/image)
