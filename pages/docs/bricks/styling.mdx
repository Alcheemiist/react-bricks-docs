# Styling

## Intro

**React Bricks works with any CSS framework** like Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material UI, CSS modules and it should work with any CSS-in-JS solution.

## CSS in JS

If you use a CSS-in-JS library, **you need to set the `useCssInJs` flag to `true`** in [React Bricks configuration](/docs/configuration/configuration).
For some CSS-in-JS libraries other steps may be required: see below.

## Styled-Components

Styled-components by default injects styles in the CSSOM in production: this prevents React Bricks from correctly inject styles in the content bricks.

Luckily the `StyleSheetManager` component, since Styled-components v5, has the `disableCSSOMInjection` property, which switches to the text-node injection system.

**So you need to wrap React Bricks' `<Admin>` component in this way:**

```tsx highlight=7
import React from 'react'
import { Admin, Editor } from 'react-bricks'
import { StyleSheetManager } from 'styled-components'

const AdminEditor: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <StyleSheetManager disableCSSOMInjection>
      <Admin>
        <Editor />
      </Admin>
    </StyleSheetManager>
  )
}

export default AdminEditor
```

## React Bricks UI

We created a beautiful collection of bricks ready to use with **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, **fully responsive** and **dark-mode** compatible.

[React Bricks UI](https://github.com/ReactBricks/react-bricks-ui) is free and already included in all the [starter projects](/docs/getting-started/starter-projects) using Tailwind!
