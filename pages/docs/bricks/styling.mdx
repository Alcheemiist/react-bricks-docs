# Styling

## Any CSS style
**React Bricks doesn't impose any CSS or CSS-in-JS framework on you.**  
The Admin interface CSS is decoupled from the page styles and the content blocks styles.

Rember that, if you use a CSS-in-JS library, you need to set the `useCssInJs` flag to `true` in [React Bricks configuration](/docs/configuration/configuration).

## React Bricks UI

We created a beautiful collection of bricks ready to use with **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, **fully responsive** and **dark-mode** compatible.

[React Bricks UI](https://github.com/ReactBricks/react-bricks-ui) is free and already included in all the [starter projects](/docs/getting-started/starter-projects) using Tailwind!
