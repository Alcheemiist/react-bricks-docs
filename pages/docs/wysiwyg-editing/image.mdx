# Image

The `Image` component shows an image with progressive loading and allows to **upload a new image**.

Upon upload, React Bricks will:

- **Create responsive optimized images**
- Save them on a **global CDN**
- Create a **light blurred placeholder** for the progressive loading

## Purpose

- **Avoid serving big images where they are not necessary**, in order to diminish the load time.
- **Serve images only when they are needed**, loading the images below the fold only when they enter the viewport.

## API

Here's the Typescript interface for the props of the `Image` component:

```ts
source: types.IImageSource
  alt: string
  maxWidth?: number
  propName: string
  onChange: (field: string, source: types.IImageSource) => void
  containerClassName?: string
  imageClassName?: string
}
```

## Properties definition

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `source` | An object as returned by the upload process. It contains all the properties that are needed to show the placeholder and the responsive images. |
| `alt` | The required alternate text for the image. We suggest that you create a `sideEditProp` to let the content editor specify the alt tag for the image. |
| `maxWidth` | This is the maximum width in pixel at which your image will be displayed. It is used to calculate the responsive images for normal and retina displays.<br /><br />The default value is 800. |
| `propName` | The name of the prop of the parent component in which this text should go. |
| `onChange` | You should pass to this callback function the `onChange` function received in your component's props. |
| `containerClassName` | Optional className to apply to the image container (wrapper created by React Bricks). |
| `imageClassName` | Optional className to apply to the `<img>` tag. |

## Usage example

```jsx
<Image
  source={imageSource}
  alt=""
  maxWidth={720}
  propName="imageSource"
  onChange={onChange}
  imageClassName="w-24 h-24 mx-auto mb-6"
/>
```
