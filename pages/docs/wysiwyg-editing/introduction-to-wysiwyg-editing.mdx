# Intro to WYSIWYG editing

React Bricks provides three components you may use in the JSX returned by your blockType's `render` function:

- `Text` **for one-line plain texts.**
- `RichText` **for multiline rich text editing.**  
  You may choose the available rich text features (bold, italic, link, code, highlight) and provide custom components for these markers.
- `Image` **to allow inline uploading of images.**  
  React Bricks will create a small size placeholder for lazy loading and responsive versions to optimize data transfer.

I think that an example is the best way to explain how WYSIWYG editing works:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Text, Plain, types } from 'react-bricks'

const SimpleText = ({ text, onChange }) => (
  <div>
    <Text
      renderBlock={(props) => <h1>{props.children}</h1>}
      placeholder="Type your text..."
      value={text}
      propName="text"
      onChange={onChange}
    />
  </div>
)

const schema = {
  name: 'simple-text',
  label: 'Simple text',
  superType: types.BlockSuperType.Single,
  render: (props) => <SimpleText {...props} />,
  getDefaultProps: () => ({
    text: Plain.deserialize('This is a simple text'),
  }),
}

export default schema
```

As you can see, this module declares the "SimpleText" functional component which is passed to the `render` prop of the exported `schema` object.

The "SimpleText" component renders React Bricks' `Text` component, because we want just a single line of plain text.

> It's important to note that the component takes the `onChange` callback function from the props and passes it through to the `Text` component. This is a thing that you have to do for all the three WYSIWYG components.

  In the next chapters, we'll see the API details for the `Text`, `RichText` and `Image` WYSIWYG
  components.
