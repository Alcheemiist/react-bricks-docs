# The Link component

Behind the scenes, the WYSIWYG text editor uses a `Link` component to render links.

This component renders a normal `<a>` tag for external links and uses the `renderLocalLink` function from the configuration to render internal links, so that they leverage either the Gatsby Router or Next.js Router.

As we saw in [RichText](/docs/wysiwyg-editing/rich-text), for each `RichText` component, you may replace the Link component with any component you want, by setting the `renderLink` prop.

> Sometimes you may want to use the `<Link>` component directly, for example if your block renders a link where the path must be provided as a side-prop.

## Props

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `href` | The URL for an external link or the local path for a local link. |
| `target` | The target for the external link (for example _"\_blank"_). |
| `children` | The content of the link. |

## Usage example

```jsx
<Link href={href}>{children}</Link>
```
