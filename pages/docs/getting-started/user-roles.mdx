# User Roles

React Bricks has 2 user roles:

- **Admin**: they can edit anything, create other users and [lock pages](/docs/getting-started/user-roles#locked-pages).
- **Editor**: they can edit all the pages, add new pages or remove pages.

## Roles and permissions details

**Admin**

- Create pages

**Editor**

- Create pages

## Locked Pages

The content of a Locked page can be edited but it isn't possible to add / remove / sort blocks, so the page structure is fixed.

For Repeater Blocks, new items can be added or removed even if the page is locked.
