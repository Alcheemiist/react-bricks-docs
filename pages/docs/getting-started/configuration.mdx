# Configuration

The main React Bricks configuration file is located in `/react-bricks/config.js`.

This file imports the `appId` and `apiKey` you set in `/credentials.config.js` and exports the complete configuration.

## Configuration object

```ts
{
  appId: string
  apiKey: string

  blockTypeSchema: IBlockType[]
  pageTypeSchema: IPageType[]

  logo: string
  contentClassName: string
  renderLocalLink: RenderLocalLink
  navigate: (path: string) => void
  loginPath: string
  editorPath: string
  playgroundPath: string
  appSettingsPath: string
}
```

We can group configuration settings into three parts: credentials, schemas and environment settings.

## Credentials

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `appId` | Identifies this React Bricks app. Configured in `/credentials.config` |
| `apiKey` | ApiKey for React Bricks APIs. Configured in `/credentials.config` |

## Schemas

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `blockTypeSchema` | This is where blocks are defined. See [The blocks schema](/docs/blocks-definition/blocks-schema) |
| `pageTypeSchema` | This is where page types are defined. See [Page types](/docs/page-types-definition/page-types) |

## Environment settings

Let alone logo and contentClassName, all of these environment settings are **already set by the starter** you choose.

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `logo` | The URL for the logo you want to appear in the Header of the Admin dashboard |
| `contentClassName` | Useful if you need a particular class applied to all of your content, so that the editing environment will look just the same as the front-end. |
| `renderLocalLink` | Very important to manage local links inside the text your users will edit.<br /><br />The default Link component React Bricks uses to render links renders a `<a>` tag for external links and uses the component returned by this function to render a local link.<br /><br />In this way you can provide your framework's router Link component (for example the Gatsby or Next `<Link>` component), so that local links are managed by the router, with the ability to prefetch pages and without triggering a full page reload.<br /><br />This function accepts one argument, which is an object with the following keys:<br />- `href`: destination path<br />- `children`: link children elements (the link description)<br />- `className`: class to be applied to links<br />- `activeClassName`: class to be applied to active links<br />- `isAdmin`: useful to do different things for the admin interface header links (used in the Next starter) |
| `navigate` | A function to navigate to a page. Typically it uses the Gatsby's router `navigate` or Next.js router's `Router.push` functions.<br /><br />React Bricks needs it to manage authentication redirects. |
| `loginPath` | Path to the Admin "Login" page. Defaults to `/admin` |
| `editorPath` | Path to the Admin "Editor" page. Defaults to `/admin/editor` |
| `playgroundPath` | Path to the Admin "Playground" page. Defaults to `/admin/playground` |
| `appSettingsPath` | Path to the Admin "App Settings" page. Defaults to `/admin/app-settings` |

## Usage example

Here you can see an example of a `config.js` file, for a Gatsby-based project:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Link, navigate } from 'gatsby'
import pageTypeSchema from './pageSchema'
import blockTypeSchema from './bricks'
import { appId, apiKey } from '../../credentials.config'
import logo from '../images/logo.svg'

const config = {
  appId,
  apiKey,
  pageTypeSchema,
  blockTypeSchema,
  logo,
  contentClassName: 'content',
  renderLocalLink: ({ href, children, className, activeClassName }) => (
    <Link to={href} className={className} activeClassName={activeClassName}>
      {children}
    </Link>
  ),
  navigate,
}

export default config
```
