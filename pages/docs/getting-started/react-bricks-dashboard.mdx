You can login with your credentials.

From the React Bricks Dashboard you can:
- See / change your **Profile** information
- **See your Apps**
- **See apps you have been invited to**
- **Create new apps**
- **Invite users** to collaborate on an App (as Admin or Editors)
- See your current **Plan** and change it

When, in the rest of the documentation, we say "Admin Dashboard" we don't mean React Bricks Dashboard, but the Content editing admin interface hosted by you, usually in the `/admin` path of the frontend website.
