# Starter projects

The best way to get you started with React Bricks is using one of the starter projects we created for Gatsby and Next.js.

The first part of the documentation explains how to use React Bricks with a starter project, while the "API Reference" section contains all the library documentation you need to create a project from scratch.

## 1. Choose your starter

Choose your starter project and set it up on your development machine.

> The Next.js starters leverage the new **Next.js 9.3 Static Site Generation** features!

We are currently creating also the TypeScript version of the starters.

## 2. Create a React Bricks app

Create a new account if you haven't yet or add a new app on the React Bricks dashboard. When you sign up a new app is created for you and you are assigned Admin privileges to it. You will receive your credentials, `appId` and `apiKey`.

## 3. Configure the starter project

In your starter project root, open the `credentials.config.js` file and fill in your app's `appId` and `apiKey`.

## 4. Discover the dashboard

- Start your project: `yarn develop` (for Gatsby) or `yarn dev` (for Next.js)
- Open your site: usually `http://localhost:8000` for Gatsby and `http://localhost:3000` for Next.js.
- Open the Admin Dashboard: `http://localhost:port/admin`
- Log in using your credentials and look around

  At this point we suggest you to [read through the next
  chapters](/docs/getting-started/configuration) to understand configuration, user roles and the
  main features of the Dashboard.

## 5. Create your content bricks

When you are at ease with the Dashboard, you may start [creating your content bricks](/docs/blocks-definition/blocks-schema).
