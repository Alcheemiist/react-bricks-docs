# React Bricks CLI

The CLI is the fastest way to start with React Bricks.

## Launch the CLI

```shell
npx create-reactbricks-app
```

Once you signed up for a free trial, you can launch the CLI, which will guide you step-by-step in the creation of your first React Bricks app.

The steps the CLI will follow are:

1. Authenticate
2. Choose an App or create a new one
3. Enter Project name and folder name
4. Choose a [Starter project](starter-projects)

## When the CLI has finished

Once the CLI has completed the scaffolding of your project, you'll be prompted to enter the project directory and run it (usually `yarn start` or `yarn dev` based on the environment).

When the app starts, we suggest that you explore the [Admin Dashboard](react-bricks-dashboard), going to the `/admin` path or clicking on the "Edit content" button in the header men√π.

## Explore the directory structure

Take a minute to explore the folder structure of your project. It is different based on the starter project that you chose, but you should find:

- The `react-bricks` folder with the `config.ts` file (which contains almost all the configuration object passed to the `<ReactBricks />` component, but for the color mode management, which needs to use hooks, so it's where the `<ReactBricks />` component is rendered, inside `_app.tsx` for Next.js and `gatsby-browser` / `gatsby-ssr` for Gatsby)
- The `components/bricks` folder with an example content block (and imported `react-bricks-ui` blocks for Tailwind-based projects)

## First configuration steps

- The first configuration step could be setting your logo for the Admin header. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration/configuration)
- Then you could start creating your first content blocks (bricks). See [What is a brick](/docs/bricks/what-is-a-brick)
