# Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard has 3 panels

- **The Editor**: this is the main panel panel where pages are created and content is edited.
- **The Playground**: this is where you can preview all the Block types defined in the [Blocks schema](/docs/blocks-definition/blocks-schema) and all the Page types defined in the [Pages schema](/docs/page-types-definition/page-types)
- **App Settings / Deploy**: here the Editor can trigger a rebuild of the static website (if hosted on Netlify or Zeit Now). The Admin may configure the App Name, Deploy configuration and Users.

## The editor

### Left panel

In the left panel you see the Pages, organized by Page Type. Clicking on a Page you can edit the page content.

### Central panel

The central panel is used to edit content (text, images) and add / remove / sort blocks.

### Right panel

The right panel has 2 tabs:

- **Block**: to edit the block properties, as defined in the [Block schema](/docs/blocks-definition/blocks-schema) (for example background color, padding, etc.)
- **Document**: to edit the page properties, like the name, slug, meta attributes (title, description), or to delete the page.

## The playground

![the playground](/dashboard_playground.png)

### Left panel

In the left panel you see all the Block types and, below, all the Page types. Clicking on a Block or Page, you'll see the details on the right.

### Central panel

The central panel shows the default content for a block or a page. Here you can test that the block works as expected with the Wysiwyg editing and the side-edit props.

### Right panel

The right panel has 2 tabs for a Block Type:

- **Props edit**: where you see the available side-edit props.
- **Allowed in**: where you see the pages where this block is available

And 2 tabs for a Page Type:

- **Block**: the usual props editing.
- **Page settings**: where you see the default status (locked/unlocked, publoshed/draft) and the blocks allowed in this page

## App Settings

Here the Admin user can set the App name and the Deploy settings (build hook), while the Editor user sees only the "Deploy" button to trigger a rebuild. Soon the Admin will be able to invite users from here.

<Callout>Now that you know the main features of the Admin Dashboard, you may start [Building your content Blocks](/docs/blocks-definition/blocks-schema).</Callout>
