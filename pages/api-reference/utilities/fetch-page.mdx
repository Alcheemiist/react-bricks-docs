# fetchPage

The fetchPage function is useful when you want to **retrieve the content of one from outside the React context** (where you could use the [usePage hook](/docs-api/hooks/use-page)).

In particular, this comes in handy during the build process of a static website. Indeed, this is the method used in our Gatsby and Next.js [starter projects](/docs/getting-started/starter-projects).

## Arguments

| Property   | Definition                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `pageSlug` | The slug (string) of the page to fetch.      |
| `apiKey`   | Api Key of your React Bricks app (a string). |

## Return value

`fetchPage` returns a **promise which resolves to a [`Page`](/docs-api/types/#page)**

Before using this page with ReactBricks' [`PageViewer`](/docs-api/components/page-viewer) component, you need to parse it with the [`cleanPage`](clean-page) function.

## Usage example

```jsx
fetchPage('about-us', 'API_KEY').then((data) => {
  const myPage = cleanPage(data, pageTypeSchema, blockTypeSchema)
  console.log(myPage.content)
})
```
