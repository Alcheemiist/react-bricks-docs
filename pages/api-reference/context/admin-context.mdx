# AdminContext

The `AdminContext` provides the context needed by the admin editing interface.

It has the following interface:

```tsx
interface IAdminContext {
  isAdmin: boolean
  currentPage: string
  setCurrentPage: (page: string) => void
  previewMode: boolean
  setPreviewMode: (previewMode: boolean) => void
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean
  setSidebarCollapsed: (sidebarCollapsed: boolean) => void
  getStyles: () => NodeListOf<HTMLStyleElement> | []
  getStylesheets: () => NodeListOf<HTMLLinkElement> | []
}
```

The [`<Admin>` component](/api-reference/components/admin) wraps all the children with the AdminContext Provider.

If you need to access this admin status variables in your components, you may use React `useContext` to access them.

> In particular, you may use the `isAdmin` flag in your bricks (block components) to do conditionally render based on the fact that the brick is in edit mode or view mode.
