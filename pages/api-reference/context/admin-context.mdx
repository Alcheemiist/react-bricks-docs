# AdminContext

The `AdminContext` provides the context needed by the admin editing interface.

It has the following interface:

```tsx
interface IAdminContext {
  isAdmin: boolean
  user: User | null
  setUser: (user: User) => void
  currentPage: string
  setCurrentPage: (page: string) => void
  previewMode: boolean
  setPreviewMode: (previewMode: boolean) => void
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean
  setSidebarCollapsed: (sidebarCollapsed: boolean) => void
  getStyles: () => NodeListOf<HTMLStyleElement> | []
  getStylesheets: () => NodeListOf<HTMLLinkElement> | []
}
```

The [Admin component](/docs-api/components/admin) wraps all the children with the AdminContext Provider.

If you need to access this admin status variables in your components, you may use React useContext to access them.

In particular, you may use `isAdmin` in your bricks (block components) to do conditionally render based on the fact that the brick is in edit mode or view mode.
