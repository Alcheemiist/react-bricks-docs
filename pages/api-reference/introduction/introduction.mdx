# API Docs Introduction

While the Documentation section was targeted at developers leveraging the starter projects, this **advanced section** is useful to developers who are creating their own architecture using React Bricks, or who need to **fully understand how React Bricks components work**.

This section explains all the components, context, hooks and utilities exported by the [`react-bricks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bricks) library.

**This section is organized by type** of exported entity and serves as a reference that you might reach from the search bar.

So, red pill and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes... üêá
