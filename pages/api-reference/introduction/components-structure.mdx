# Components structure

## ReactBricks

The [`<ReactBricks>`](../components/react-bricks) component wraps everything and it acts as a **Provider** for the [`<ReactBricksContext>`](../context/react-bricks-context) that make the configuration available through Context to all the other components.

## Frontend site

The frontend website uses the [`<PageViewer>`](../components/page-viewer) component to **render a page**. It has a `page` prop which expects the content of a [Page](/docs/admin-dashboard/pages) from React Bricks API (see also [`usePage`](../hooks/use-page) and [`fetchPage`](../utilities/fetch-page)).  It renders your bricks with React Bricks visual edit components (Text, RichText, Image) in read-only mode.

**Images** are lazy loaded and an optimized version is requested based on screen resolution. 
The **Repeater** components render your nested block as they do in the Admin interface.

If you are logged in the Admin, the PageViewer components renders also a **floating edit button**, so that you can directly go to the dashboard to edit the page you are viewing.

## Admin

On the Admin, every component should be wrapped also by the [`<Admin>`](../components/admin) component, which manages **authentication** and renders the Dashboard **menu**.

The [`<Admin>`](../components/admin) component contains also a **Provider** for the [`AdminContext`](../context/admin-context) (current page, preview mode, etc.).

If you build the admin dashboard yourself, you should create **views** (routed by your router) for the login, editor, playground and page settings pages.
Each of these views will have the wrapping [`<Admin>`](../components/admin) component and the view-related component: [`<Login>`](../components/login), [`<Editor>`](../components/editor), [`<Playground>`](../components/playground), [`<AppSettings>`](../components/app-settings)
