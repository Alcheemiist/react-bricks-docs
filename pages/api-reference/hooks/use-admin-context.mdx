# useAdminContext

```ts
const useAdminContext = (): types.IReadAdminContext
```

Hook with no argument to access some useful values from the Admin context. It returns an object.

### Example usage

```ts
const { isAdmin, previewMode } = useAdminContext()
```

# AdminContext

The `AdminContext` provides the context needed by the admin editing interface.

The `useAdminContext` exported values have the following interface

```ts
interface IReadAdminContext {
  isAdmin: boolean
  previewMode: boolean
}
```

- `isAdmin` is `true` in the Admin dashboard and `false` on the public front-end.
- `previewMode` is `true` when Preview is active in the Admin dashboard and `false` otherwise.

The [`<Admin>` component](/api-reference/components/admin) wraps all the children with the AdminContext Provider.
