# Editor

This component **renders the Editor page** for React Bricks [Admin Dashboard](/docs/admin-dashboard/overview).  
The Editor is where you **edit your page content**.

It needs no props, but it must be wrapped by the [Admin](admin) component to receive the needed context.

The route where this component is shown has to be specified in [ReactBricks](react-bricks)'s [configuration](/docs/configuration/configuration) parameter `editorPath`.
