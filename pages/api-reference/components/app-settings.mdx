# AppSettings

This component **renders the AppSettings page** for React Bricks [Admin Dashboard](/docs/admin-dashboard/overview).    
The AppSettings page is where you **configure and trigger the build webhooks** if you are using a static website generator like Gatsby or Next.js.

It needs no props, but it must be wrapped by the [Admin](admin) component to receive the needed context.

The route where this component is shown has to be specified in [ReactBricks](react-bricks)'s [configuration](/docs/configuration/configuration) parameter `appSettingsPath`.
