# Playground

This component **renders the Playground page** for React Bricks [Admin Dashboard](/docs/getting-started/admin-dashboard).  
The Playground is useful to **preview and test your content blocks**.

It needs no props, but it must be wrapped by the [Admin](admin) component to receive the needed context.

The route where this component is shown has to be specified in [ReactBricks](react-bricks)'s [configuration](/docs/getting-started/configuration) parameter `playgroundPath`.
