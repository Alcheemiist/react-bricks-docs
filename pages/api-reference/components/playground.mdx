# Playground

This component **renders the Playground page** for React Bricks [Admin Dashboard](/docs/admin-dashboard/overview).  
The Playground is useful to **preview and test your bricks**.

It needs no props, but it must be wrapped by the [Admin](admin) component to receive the needed context.

The route where this component is shown has to be specified in [ReactBricks](react-bricks)'s [configuration](/docs/configuration/configuration) parameter `playgroundPath`.
