# Playground

This component **renders the Playground page** for React Bricks [Admin Dashboard](/docs/admin-dashboard/overview).  
The Playground is useful to **preview and test your bricks**.

It needs no props, but it must be wrapped by the [Admin](admin) component to receive the needed context.

The route where this component is shown has to be specified in [ReactBricks](react-bricks)'s [configuration](/docs/configuration/configuration) parameter `playgroundPath`.

## Usage example

```tsx highlight=2,7
import React from 'react'
import { Admin, Playground } from 'react-bricks'

const PlaygroundPage = () => {
  return (
    <Admin>
      <Playground />
    </Admin>
  )
}

export default PlaygroundPage
```
